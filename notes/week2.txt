Implement the ArticleService and the ArticleDatabase. 
The ArticleService needs four endpoints for Create, Read, Update and Delete. 
It must be implemented as a REST-based API.

You have to perform a x-axis split on the ArticleService so that three instances 
are available with a load balancer to take care of which instance will service the incoming request.

Furthermore you have to perform a y-axis split on the ArticleDatabase such that each continent has their own database. 
Along with the seven continent database and eighth database will contain news articles thatâ€™s relevant across the entire world - a global database so-to-speak
